Option 2: Using Unity's Tilemap System

    Set Up a Tilemap for Hexagons:
        Go to GameObject > 2D Object > Tilemap > Hexagonal Flat-Top (or Hexagonal Point-Top).
        Unity will automatically create a Grid parent object and a child Tilemap.

    Add a Hexagonal Tile:
        Right-click in the Assets folder and select Create > 2D > Tiles > Hexagonal Tile.
        Name the tile (e.g., HexTile).
        Assign a hexagonal sprite to the new tile by dragging your sprite into the Sprite field in the Inspector.
        Drag the tile into the Tilemap in the scene.

    Customize the Tilemap:
        Use the Tile Palette window to paint hex tiles onto the Tilemap.

******

Option 3: Procedural Hexagonal Mesh (3D)

    Create a 3D Hexagonal Mesh:
        Use a 3D modeling tool like Blender to create a hexagonal mesh, or procedurally generate one using a Unity script.

    Script to Generate a Grid: Here's a script to create a simple hexagonal grid procedurally:

Prepare the Prefab:

    Create or import a hexagonal 3D model, add a collider, and save it as a prefab.
    Assign this prefab to the hexTilePrefab field in the script.

Attach the Script:

    Create an empty GameObject and name it "HexGrid".
    Attach the script to this object.
    Assign your hex tile prefab to the hexTilePrefab field.

*****

Steps to Implement

    Set Up the GameObject:
        Create a new GameObject in your scene (e.g., "CMBBackground").
        Attach the CMBGenerator script to the GameObject.
        Ensure the GameObject has a Renderer component (e.g., a Quad or Plane).

    Create a Material:
        Create a new material in Unity.
        Assign it to the Renderer of the GameObject.
        Use the default shader (e.g., Unlit/Texture) for simplicity.

    Configure the Inspector:
        Adjust the textureResolution, noiseScale, distortionIntensity, and colors in the Inspector.

    Dynamic Adjustments:
        Use the provided methods SetDistortion(float) and SetNoiseScale(float) to dynamically alter the map in-game based on events or ship sensors.

Features

    Adjustable Parameters:
    The noise scale, distortion intensity, and colors can be adjusted in real-time to simulate various anomalies or sensor upgrades.

    Dynamic Updates:
    The CMB pattern refreshes each frame, providing a live, dynamic effect.

    Extendable:
    You can integrate advanced shaders for a more realistic CMB effect, such as adding gradient distortion or thermal hotspots.

*****

In Unity, Quads and Planes are 3D objects, and they use the Mesh Renderer component. Here's how you can add a quad or a plane to your scene:
Adding a Quad

    Create a Quad:
        Go to the top menu: GameObject > 3D Object > Quad.
        A flat 3D Quad will be added to your scene.
        The Quad will automatically have a Mesh Renderer component attached.

    Position and Scale:
        Position the Quad in front of your camera.
        Scale it to fit your scene as needed.

    Add a Material:
        Assign a material with a texture (like your CMB map) to the Quad's Mesh Renderer.

Adding a Plane

    Create a Plane:
        Go to the top menu: GameObject > 3D Object > Plane.
        A flat 3D Plane will be added to your scene. Unlike a Quad, a Plane has more vertices, which can be useful for more detailed effects.
        The Plane will also have a Mesh Renderer component.

    Position and Scale:
        Place the Plane in front of your camera.
        Adjust the scale for your scene.

    Add a Material:
        Assign a material to the Mesh Renderer.

Converting Quad/Plane for a Background

If you're using the Quad or Plane as a background:

    Set to Background Layer:
        Create a new layer for "Background" and assign the Quad/Plane to it.
        Use a second camera or adjust the render order of your main camera to ensure it appears behind other objects.

    Lighting Considerations:
        Use an Unlit Material (e.g., Unlit/Texture) so the background isn’t affected by lighting.

If you're using 2D mode or the Sprite Renderer, you can create a sprite for the CMB instead. Let me know if you’d like instructions on that!

****

How to Use This Script

    Set Up the Material:
        Create a material for your CMB texture.
        Use a custom shader that supports properties _ScanProgress and _DistortionLevel. (See example shader below.)

    Assign the Material:
        Assign this material to the cmbMaterial field in the RadiationScanner script.

    Connect the Scanner Origin and Target:
        Set the scannerOrigin to your scanning device (e.g., a ship or satellite).
        Assign target to a celestial object in the scene, or leave it null if scanning is independent of specific objects.

    Dynamic Interference:
        Use the AddInterference(float intensity) and ReduceInterference(float intensity) methods to simulate changes in interference caused by nearby anomalies.

***

Setting Up in Unity

    Create the Pulsar Prefab:
        Create a new GameObject (e.g., a sphere).
        Add a Pulsar component to the GameObject.
        Optionally, add visual effects like a glowing material or particle system to make it look like a pulsar.
        Save it as a prefab (e.g., PulsarPrefab).

    Set Up the Spawner:
        Create an empty GameObject (e.g., "PulsarSpawner").
        Attach the PulsarSpawner script to the GameObject.
        Assign the pulsar prefab to the pulsarPrefab field.
        Assign the player’s ship to the player field.
        Set the desired number of pulsars and universe bounds in the Inspector.

    Run the Scene:
        When you play the scene, pulsars will spawn randomly within the specified bounds.
        Use the LockOntoClosestPulsar method to lock onto the nearest pulsar.

Additional Features to Consider

    Triangulation:
        Add methods to calculate positions based on signal strength from multiple pulsars.
        Use the Frequency property to simulate unique signatures for identification.

    Visual Effects:
        Add pulsating light or particle systems to represent the pulsar’s emissions.

    Dynamic Spawning:
        Spawn pulsars dynamically as the player explores new areas of the universe.

Explanation of the DiplomacyManager Script:

    Factions:
        The DiplomacyManager manages a list of factions, represented by the Faction class.
        Each faction has a name, reputation, and status (Neutral, Allied, or Hostile).

    Reputation System:
        Reputation is tracked between the player’s faction and other factions.
        If the reputation is above the allianceThreshold, the faction becomes Allied.
        If the reputation is below the hostilityThreshold, the faction becomes Hostile.
        If the reputation is in between, the faction remains Neutral.

    Trade Agreements:
        The ProposeTradeAgreement function allows factions to engage in trade, improving their mutual reputation.
        Trade agreements cannot be established with hostile factions.

    Messaging:
        The SendMessage function can be used to simulate communication between factions, with the ability to log messages sent from one faction to another.

    War Declaration:
        The DeclareWar function is used to declare war on a faction. This could lead to combat mechanics or other consequences.

How to Use:

    Add the Script:
        Attach the DiplomacyManager script to a GameObject in your scene (e.g., a GameController object).
        In the Inspector, you can manually add factions to the factions list.

    Modify Factions:
        You can customize each faction's name and starting reputation.

    Reputation Modifications:
        Use the UpdateDiplomacy method to modify a faction’s reputation when actions occur, such as trade, combat, or diplomacy.

    Trade and Diplomacy:
        Call the ProposeTradeAgreement function to establish trade deals.
        Call SendMessage to simulate communication, or DeclareWar to initiate a war with another faction.

Expanding on This Script:

    AI Diplomacy: You can further enhance AI factions by adding logic for them to propose trade agreements, send diplomatic messages, or even declare war based on their current status and the player’s actions.
    Event Triggers: Add more complex event triggers (e.g., mutual interests, territorial disputes) to make diplomacy more dynamic.

Let me know if you'd like further modifications or additions to this script!

*******
Explanation of the Script:

    Game Events List:
        The EventManager script manages a list of predefined events stored in gameEvents. Each event contains a name, description, and event type.
        A timer (eventTimer) controls when new random events are triggered.

    Event Types:
        Events are categorized into types (EventType), including EngineBreakdown, MutualInterests, TradeProposal, RescueMission, SpaceEvents, and others like Gamma Flares and Pirate Ambushes.

    Event Triggering:
        At regular intervals (eventTriggerInterval), the TriggerRandomEvent() function selects a random event and passes it to the HandleEvent() method for processing.

    Handling Events:
        Each event type is handled separately in its own function (e.g., HandleEngineBreakdown(), HandleSpaceEvent()).
        The space events (Gravitational Waves, Gamma Flares) modify the environment and ship status.

    Customizable Events:
        New events can easily be added to the gameEvents list and corresponding logic can be created for handling them.

How to Use:

    Attach to GameObject:
        Attach the EventManager script to a GameObject in your scene (e.g., GameController).

    Customize Events:
        You can adjust the eventTriggerInterval for how often events are triggered.
        Modify the event descriptions and add new events to suit your game’s narrative.

    Implement Logic:
        You can expand the individual handling methods (like HandleEngineBreakdown()) to include specific actions or consequences for the player.

This script provides a foundation for random and dynamic event handling in your game. You can build out more complex logic based on your game mechanics, adding deeper interactions and consequences as events trigger. Let me know if you need more customization!

******

Explanation of the Script:

    Morale Settings:
        maxMorale: The highest morale level (default is 100).
        minMorale: The lowest morale level, which triggers a work strike (default is 0).
        currentMorale: Tracks the current morale level.
        moraleDecrementRate: The rate at which morale decreases over time due to negative events.

    Event Impact Settings:
        Defines the impact values for different events on morale (e.g., crew death, food shortage, entertainment, and successful missions).
        You can easily adjust these values to fit the narrative or mechanics of your game.

    Ship Areas Affected by Strikes:
        shipAreas: A list of areas within the ship that can be disabled during a work strike (e.g., engine bay, weapons bay, etc.).
        Each area has a method to DisableArea() during a strike and RestoreArea() after a strike is resolved.

    Event Application:
        The ApplyEventImpact() method applies the corresponding impact to the morale based on the type of event (e.g., CrewDeath, FoodShortage, EntertainingActivities, SuccessfulMission).

    Work Strike Logic:
        When morale reaches minMorale, a work strike begins. This affects various ship areas and makes them temporarily unavailable (e.g., engine malfunction, weapons bay offline).
        The InitiateWorkStrike() method handles the strike, disabling the areas for a set duration (strikeDuration), and then restores them once the strike ends.

    Event Handlers:
        You can call methods like OnCrewDeath(), OnFoodShortage(), OnEntertainment(), and OnSuccessfulMission() from other game systems to trigger these morale events and adjust morale accordingly.

How to Use:

    Attach the Script:
        Attach the MoraleSystem script to a GameObject in your scene (e.g., GameController or Ship).

    Assign Ship Areas:
        Create a list of ShipArea objects in the inspector, where each object represents a specific area on the ship (e.g., Engine Bay, Weapons Bay, etc.).
        Define the names of the areas and whether they are disabled during a strike.

    Trigger Events:
        Use the ApplyEventImpact() method to apply morale changes based on various in-game events.
        Call OnCrewDeath(), OnFoodShortage(), OnEntertainment(), or OnSuccessfulMission() to simulate real-time events affecting morale.

    Monitor Morale:
        You can track and adjust the currentMorale value through the Unity Inspector or by using debug logs.

Customization:

    You can expand the types of morale events based on your game (e.g., sabotage, critical mission failures, etc.).
    The moraleDecrementRate and event impacts can be fine-tuned to reflect the game's difficulty or narrative tone.
    Add more areas in the ShipArea list for different ship sections and customize the strike consequences.

This script sets the foundation for a dynamic and reactive morale system in your game, where player actions and events directly affect the efficiency of the crew and ship. Let me know if you need additional features or modifications!

        starPrefab, planetPrefab, anomalyPrefab: Prefabs for stars, planets, and anomalies. These can be created in Unity and assigned in the inspector.

    Exploration Settings:
        player: The player's Transform to track their position.
        revealDistance: The distance around the player where new sectors are revealed (based on exploration).

    Generate Map:
        The GenerateMap() function generates the entire map grid with stars, planets, and anomalies in each sector.
        Each sector has a random number of stars, and each star can have a random number of planets.

    Sector Generation:
        GenerateSector(Vector2 sectorPosition): Creates a new sector and places stars, planets, and anomalies within that sector.
        Each star has a random number of planets around it, and anomalies are placed randomly in each sector.

    Revealing New Sectors:
        As the player moves, the map is gradually revealed by calling RevealNearbySectors(). This checks the player's position and generates any sectors within a specified radius if they haven't already been revealed.

    Sector Class:
        The Sector class stores the stars, planets, and anomalies in each sector, allowing for easy management and updating of each sector’s contents.

How to Use:

    Attach the Script:
        Attach the StarMapGenerator script to an empty GameObject (e.g., StarMapController or GameController).

    Assign Prefabs:
        In the Unity Inspector, assign the prefabs for stars, planets, and anomalies (you can create simple placeholder models for these).

    Set Player and Reveal Distance:
        Assign the player's Transform to the player field.
        Adjust revealDistance to determine how far around the player new sectors will be generated.

    Test:
        As the player moves, new sectors will be revealed and populated with stars, planets, and anomalies.

Customization:

    More Events: Add additional events like black holes, space stations, or asteroid fields within each sector.
    Difficulty Scaling: The number of planets, stars, or anomalies could increase with the player’s progression in the game.
    Sector Types: You could introduce different types of sectors (e.g., dangerous regions, empty space, or resource-rich sectors) to vary the experience.

This script provides a procedural generation framework for creating a dynamic and explorative star map for your game, enabling the player to reveal new sectors as they explore and interact with the universe. Let me know if you need additional features or adjustments!

Explanation of the Script:

    Inventory Settings:
        maxStorageCapacity: Overall max capacity for the inventory (this could be expanded to separate storage for different types).
        resourceStorageCapacity, foodStorageCapacity, artifactStorageCapacity, fightersCapacity: Defines the capacity for specific inventory types (resources, food, artifacts, and fighters/bombers).

    Inventory Data:
        The script defines lists for storing different item types: resources, foodItems, artifacts, and fightersAndBombers.
        Each item type has its own class, which stores essential properties (like name and quantity).

    Add Item Functions:
        Functions like AddResource, AddFood, AddArtifact, and AddFighterBomber are responsible for adding items to the inventory.
        These functions check if there’s enough capacity to add the new items.

    Auto-Organization:
        The OrganizeInventory method sorts the inventory lists by item name. This is helpful for auto-organizing the inventory when needed.
        You can enable or disable auto-organization with the autoOrganize boolean.

    Crafting and Trading:
        The UseResource function is for using a certain quantity of resources (e.g., crafting upgrades).
        The TradeResources function handles the trade of resources between players or factions.

    Display Inventory:
        The DisplayInventory method prints out the current contents of the inventory to the Unity Console. You can use this for debugging or for setting up a UI.

How to Use:

    Attach the Script:
        Attach the InventoryManager script to an empty GameObject (e.g., InventoryController) in your scene.

    Define Item Prefabs (optional):
        If you're using the script for UI purposes, you can create item prefabs (such as for food or resources) and populate the InventoryManager's lists accordingly.

    Access the Inventory:
        You can access the inventory data through public methods like AddResource, AddFood, DisplayInventory, or TradeResources to integrate with gameplay systems, such as crafting or trading with NPC factions.

    Crafting and Resource Usage:
        Use UseResource to simulate crafting or upgrading when the player spends resources.

Customization:

    More Item Types: You can extend the script by adding new item types, like weapons or tools, and define custom behaviors for them.
    UI Integration: To show this inventory in the UI, you can expose the lists to a UI manager script, which would display item details in your inventory UI.
    Upgrade Crafting: Add functions that allow crafting upgrades using specific resources, such as creating new parts for the ship or unlocking new abilities.

This script sets up a flexible inventory management system for various items like resources, food, artifacts, and fighters/bombers, with support for auto-organization, resource usage, and trading mechanics. Let me know if you need further customization or features!

        resourceCostPerResearch: The amount of resources required for each research (this can be extended for different resources).
        dataCostPerResearch: The amount of "data" required for each research (you may define data as a specific item in your inventory).
        isResearching: A flag to check if a research process is in progress.
        researchProgress: Tracks the current progress of the research.

    Research Tree:
        The ResearchNode class defines each research technology, including its name, description, data and resource requirements, time required to complete, and whether it is unlocked or completed.
        The researchTree list holds all available research nodes.

    Start Research:
        The StartResearch method is called when the player wants to start researching a technology. It checks if the player has enough resources and data to start the research.
        If the conditions are met, it begins the research process.

    Complete Research:
        The CompleteResearch method checks if the research progress has reached 100%. When complete, it unlocks the technology and applies any associated benefits (e.g., upgrading ship systems).
        The research progress is updated over time (Update method).

    Unlocking Benefits:
        The UnlockResearchBenefits method is where you can implement the actual benefits of each research technology (e.g., unlocking new ship modules, increasing ship speed, etc.).

    Display Research Tree:
        The DisplayResearchTree method is for debugging or showing the current research tree and their status (locked/unlocked).

How to Use:

    Attach the Script:
        Attach this ResearchManager script to a GameObject in your scene (e.g., ResearchController).

    Inventory Integration:
        The script requires access to your InventoryManager to check resources like "Data" and "Metal." Ensure your InventoryManager is linked.

    Start Research:
        To start a research, call the StartResearch(int researchIndex) method with the index of the research you want to unlock. For example, StartResearch(0) to start researching the first technology.

    Unlocking Technologies:
        Once a technology is completed, the UnlockResearchBenefits method will be triggered to apply the benefits, such as ship upgrades or new capabilities.

    Display the Research Tree:
        Call DisplayResearchTree() for debugging or display purposes to show the current progress and unlocked technologies.

Customization:

    Research Tree Expansion: You can add more ResearchNode entries in the researchTree list, each with its own requirements and benefits.
    Advanced Progression: To make the research process more complex, you could introduce dependencies between technologies (e.g., unlocking "Advanced Engines" requires "Basic Engines" to be unlocked first).
    UI Integration: You can create a UI to display the research tree and progress, providing visual feedback to the player.

This script gives you a foundation for a research and development system that dynamically evolves your ship’s capabilities and allows for progression over time. Let me know if you'd like to add any more specific features!

Key Features of EngineSystem.cs:

    Basic Ship Movement:
        The ship can accelerate up to a maximum speed and decelerate when the controls are released or a stop command is given.
        Movement is capped to the maxSpeed, and a deceleration rate is applied when movement stops.

    Warp System:
        The ship can initiate a warp sequence by charging up for a set amount of time (warpChargeTime).
        During warp, the ship consumes fuel (warpFuelConsumptionRate), and the warp can be interrupted or stopped if required.
        Once the warp is completed, the ship resumes normal movement.

    Fuel Management:
        Regular movement consumes fuel based on the fuelConsumptionRate.
        If fuel runs out, the ship stops moving and enters a "drift" mode until fuel is replenished.

    Combat Integration:
        When entering combat, the ship stops all movement and warp-related actions.
        Once the combat ends, the ship can resume normal movement and warp operations.

    Energy & Fuel Consumption:
        Fuel consumption is tied to both regular movement and warp travel. As fuel depletes, the ship's capabilities become limited until refueled.

How It Integrates with Other Systems:

    The EngineSystem integrates with the CombatSystem, where the engine is disabled during combat (you can’t warp or move).
    The Fuel System ensures the ship has enough resources for travel and combat, and the ship's InventoryManager can handle the refueling process.

By using this system, you can create a well-rounded space travel and combat mechanic, where the ship's mobility and combat effectiveness are closely tied to its fuel levels, warp capabilities, and propulsion power.

Key Features of CommunicationManager.cs:

    Message Handling:
        The script handles displaying messages from different sources like crew, factions, or events.
        Messages are displayed with a delay (messageDisplayTime) and can have different possible responses.

    Choice-Based Responses:
        The player is presented with choices such as "Yes", "No", and "Maybe". Each response has consequences that can affect resources, morale, and diplomacy.
        Consequences are predefined in the responseConsequences dictionary, where you can specify how the game world changes based on the player's decision.

    Event Triggering:
        Based on the player's choice, different events are triggered using the EventTrigger system. For example, a "Maybe" response could lead to a mission or event being triggered.
        The script can trigger events like "ArtifactRecovery" or "MissionProposal" by calling methods from EventTrigger.cs.

    Diplomatic Messaging:
        The player can send messages to factions, affecting relations. This is useful for diplomacy mechanics, where player decisions can affect faction standings.

    Crew Interaction:
        The script allows for messages directed to the crew, influencing morale or triggering alerts for specific ship-wide events.

    Sound Effects:
        Sounds are played when receiving or sending messages, helping with immersion.

How It Integrates with Other Systems:

    Crew Morale: The crewManager.ModifyMorale method allows for responses to directly influence crew morale, a crucial part of maintaining the ship’s efficiency.
    Diplomacy: The diplomacyManager.AlterFactionRelation modifies the player's relationship with factions based on communication responses.
    Resource Management: Responses may affect resources using the inventoryManager.AddResource method (e.g., gaining fuel or losing supplies).
    Event System: Responses can trigger in-game events using the eventTrigger.TriggerEvent method, linking communication with the dynamic events of the game world.

Expanding the Communication System:

    You can expand this system with more complex branching dialogues, random event generation, or even include voice lines or animations to enhance player immersion.
    You might also add more nuanced responses and consequences based on the player's previous decisions, reputation, or other game stats.

Key Features of ResourceManager.cs:

    Resource Tracking:
        This script tracks several resources, including fuel, food, raw materials, and energy.
        Each resource has specific consumption rates (e.g., fuel for engines, food for crew).

    Consumption and Decay:
        Fuel and food are consumed based on time and gameplay actions (e.g., ship movement, crew consumption).
        Food decays over time due to spoilage, and raw materials decay for repairs or use.
        Fighter and bomber fuel consumption is tracked and deducted when deployed.

    Resource Addition:
        Resources can be added dynamically (e.g., after mining, trading, or mission completion).
        The AddResource method ensures that no resource value goes negative after adding.

    Resource Consumption:
        The ConsumeResource method is used to deduct resources when the player performs actions (e.g., fuel consumption for engines, food for crew, etc.).
        The HasEnoughResources method checks if there are enough resources to perform specific actions before executing them.

    Fighter and Bomber Management:
        The script tracks fuel consumption when launching fighters or bombers, ensuring that fuel usage is accurate and dynamic.

    Crew Food Consumption:
        Crew food consumption is based on the number of crew members, and food is deducted regularly.

    UI Integration:
        Methods like GetResourceAmount can be used to display current resource counts in the UI.

How It Integrates with Other Systems:

    Engine System: Works with EngineSystem to track fuel consumption as the ship moves, and ensures that the fuel consumption rate is considered when traveling.
    Fighter Management: Works with FighterManager to track fuel consumption when launching fighters or bombers.
    Crew Manager: Integrates with CrewManager to track crew food consumption based on the size of the crew.
    Resource Consumption: Tracks and ensures that the player has sufficient resources for actions such as engine activation, fighter launches, repairs, and upgrades.

This script can be expanded with more features, such as resource gathering from planetary exploration, resource trade between factions, or adding resource-related events like resource shortages, surpluses, or special resource discoveries. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
